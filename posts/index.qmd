I love artificial intelligence and its uses. In fact, I don't currently work in geosciences but rather as an artificial intelligence instructor. I don't believe AI is an enemy that needs to be fought. History shows us that those who thrive are the ones who adapt to technology. And much of what I intend to bring here will be software and code partially generated with AI. However, the idea of writing a blog with AI doesn't appeal to me. The core purpose of such a medium is to share personal thoughts, and I see no value in sharing AI-generated content.

So, you can rest assured that all the text shared here will be an expression from a human being. I'll likely make mistakes and share some not-so-clever things at times, but that's part of my growth process. So, you're very welcome if you'd like to read about geosciences, AI, other technologies, and my discussions on these topics.

Otherwise, know that I fucked the ass of whoever read this far :).
